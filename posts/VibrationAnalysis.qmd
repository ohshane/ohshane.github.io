## Introduction

Vibration analysis is a critical aspect of mechanical engineering, allowing us to understand and optimize the dynamic behavior of machinery and structures. From diagnosing faults to designing stable systems, vibration analysis plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliability and safety.

## Objectives of Vibration Analysis

- Design Optimization
   - Prevent **resonance**, which can cause excessive amplitude and potential failure.
   - Example: Turbine blades, aircraft wings, building structures.

- Condition Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis
   - Early detection of faults in components like bearings, gears, and shafts.
   - Supports **predictive maintenance** (PM) by identifying anomalies in frequency data.
   - Strategies of PM.
      - TBM: Time-based maintenance
      - CBM: Condition-based maintenance

## Key Techniques

### Time Domain Analysis
Examines signal variations over time to compute values like:

- RMS (Root Mean Square)
- Peak-to-peak amplitude
- Maximum amplitude

### Frequency Domain Analysis
Transforms signals to the frequency domain to analyze components like:

- Dominant frequencies
- Amplitude and phase relationships
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

## Applications in Real-World Scenarios

### Rotating Machinery
- Diagnose **bearing faults** by detecting anomalies at specific frequencies.
- Identify **imbalances** based on amplitude in rotational frequencies.
