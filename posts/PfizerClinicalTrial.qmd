## Definition of Vaccine Efficacy

The efficacy of an arbitrary vaccine is defined by various parameters.
A [blog post](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/vaccine-efficacy-effectiveness-and-protection)
published from the World Health Organization (commonly known as WHO) describes this in much greater detail.

Vaccine efficacy (VE) requires two sample groups for calculation.
Although unequal group sizes are acceptable,
best practice is to make the sample sizes as equal as possible.
The control and test groups will be prescribed placebo and vaccine, respectively.

In the context of the protocol, the key consideration is the extent of deviation between
the actual and the stipulated group sizes.
The discrepancy in group sizes will later be evaluated using chi-sqaure test.

$$
\mathrm{VE} = 100 \dfrac{\pi_P - \pi_V}{\pi_P}
$$

- $\pi_P$: Proportion of subjects infected after receiving the placebo.
- $\pi_V$: Proportion of subjects infected after vaccinated.

By setting the value of $\pi_P = 0.8$ and $\pi_V = 0.72$,
the VE can be calculated as $10\%$.
Notice that VE is theoretically between $-\infty$ and $100$.

For the ease of modeling VE, numerical bound composed with $(0,1)$ is preferred.

For modeling, it is commonly preferred to use the numerical range between $(0,1)$.
