When adding up terms in a sequence with a specific pattern,
such as a geometric sequence, using a formula or recognizing a pattern can make the process much easier.

Let's see how it works.

$$
a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, \cdots, ar^n
$$

The sequence above is an arbitrary geometric sequence,
where each character denotes the following:

- $a$: the first term
- $r$: the common ratio

The sum from the first term to the n-th term can be calculated using the following formula.

$$
\begin{align*}
S_n &= a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} \\
rS_n &= ar + ar^2 + ar^3 \cdots + ar^n \\
rS_n - S_n &= ar^n - a \\
S_n &= \dfrac{a(r^n - 1)}{r-1}
\end{align*}
$$

Let's take an example.

$$
1 + 2 + 4 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1
$$

This can be easily seen when counting nodes in a complete binary tree
or calculating the moving average of a gradient using the momentum.

  1 -- 2
  1 -- 3
  2 -- 4
  
}
```
