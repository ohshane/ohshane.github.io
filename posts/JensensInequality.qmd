Jensen's inequality
:::

Jensen's inequality generalizes the statement that
the secant line of a **convex function** lies above the graph of the function[^wiki-01].

[^wiki-01]: [Jensen's inequality - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen's_inequality)

$f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is convex when,

$$
\forall t \in [0,1], f(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2) \leq tf(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2)
$$

Jensen's inequality with probability theory
:::

When $\varphi: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is a convex function,

$$
\begin{align*}
\varphi(\mathbb E [X]) &\leq \mathbb E [\varphi(X)] \\[10pt]
\varphi \left( \sum p(x_i) \ x_i \right) &\leq \sum p(x_i) \varphi(x_i) \\
\end{align*}
$$


### Finite form

When $\varphi: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ is a convex function,

$$
\varphi \left( \dfrac{\sum a_i x_i}{\sum a_i} \right) \leq \dfrac{\sum a_i \varphi(x_i)}{\sum a_i}
$$

Jensen's inequality also can be applied under weighted average conditions.

### Examples

$$
\mathrm{Var}[X] = \mathbb E[X^2] - \mathbb E[X]^2
$$

When $\varphi: x \mapsto x^2$, $\varphi$ is convex, which makes $\mathbb E[X]^2 \leq \mathbb E[X^2]$.
This is correct because the variance of random variables cannot be negative.
