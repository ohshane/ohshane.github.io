This document is based on a bare-metal Raspberry Pi Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, as discussed in the previous [post](RaspiK8s.qmd).
To facilitate external access, a load balancer like `MetalLB` is required. The setup of `MetalLB` was covered in the previous post.

For this guide, we will use the Ingress-Nginx Controller.

## Introduction

So, what is an ingress?
There are two kinds of network communication: Ingress and Egress.

- Ingress --- Controls external access to services within the cluster, typically via HTTP/HTTPS. It acts as a gateway for handling incoming traffic and routing it to the appropriate backend services.
- Egress --- Manages outbound traffic from the cluster to external services. It defines policies to regulate how pods can communicate with external networks.

Ingress is particularly useful for exposing services via a single endpoint while managing SSL termination, path-based routing, and load balancing.
In contrast, egress rules help enforce security by restricting outbound connections.
Manipulating ingress resource is similar to manipulating Nginx server with `nginx.conf`.

The basic architecture is as follows.

[![Nginx ingress architecture](NginxIngress/images/nginx-ingress-arch.png){#fig-ingress-nginx-arch}](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/exposing-kubernetes-applications-part-3-nginx-ingress-controller/)

There is a detailed post about the [Ingress-Nginx Controller](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/exposing-kubernetes-applications-part-3-nginx-ingress-controller/) from the AWS blog. 
Simply replace the load balancer in the @fig-ingress-nginx-arch with `MetalLB` service which
is already exposed using the Ingress-Nginx Controller Service. This comes right out of the box.
  
## Installation

Installing the NGINX Ingress Controller is straightforward. Refer to the [official guide](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#bare-metal-clusters) and apply the following configuration.

This setup includes two primary components:

- Deployment --- responsible for running the ingress controller pods
- Service --- exposing the ingress controller to the network

```{.yaml}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/version: 1.12.0
  name: ingress-nginx-controller
  namespace: ingress-nginx
spec:
  ipFamilies:
  - IPv4
  ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack
  ports:
  - appProtocol: http
    name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: http
  - appProtocol: https
    name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: https
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: controller
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
  type: NodePort # <1>
```
1. The default network type is `NodePort`. Change this to `LoadBalancer` when using `MetalLB`.

## Exposing the Ingress Controller

To expose the ingress controller, define a service of type `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.

```{.sh}
$ kubectl edit svc ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
```
To route traffic to services inside your cluster, create an Ingress resource.
This routes `https://shaneoh.org` traffic to the `https://www.shaneoh.org` Kubernetes service on port 80.

```{.yaml filename=redirect-root-to-www.yaml}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: redirect-root-to-www
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / # <1>
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/permanent-redirect: "http://www.shaneoh.org"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: "shaneoh.org"
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: placeholder-service
            port:
              number: 80
```
1. The routing path handled by the ingress service is omitted and then passed to the services.

After creating the resource, check if it is running correctly by:

```{.sh}
$ kubectl get ingress

NAME                   CLASS   HOSTS         ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
redirect-root-to-www   nginx   shaneoh.org   192.168.0.11   80      5d9h
```
