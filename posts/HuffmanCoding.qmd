Huffman coding is a popular algorithm used in lossless data compression.
It was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT,
and it is widely used in various compression formats, including ZIP files and image formats like JPEG.

## Concepts

Huffman coding is a type of **variable-length prefix coding** that assigns shorter codes to more frequent symbols and longer code to less frequent symbols.
