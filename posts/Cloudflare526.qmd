## Introduction

```
[Browser]--- A ---[Cloudflare]--- B ---[Origin server]
```

When using Cloudflare as a reverse proxy:

### Connection A
This connection is between the end-user's browser and Cloudflare's edge servers.
It is typically encrypted via free SSL certificate.

### Connection B
This is the connection between Cloudflare and your origin server.
It can be either HTTP or HTTPS depending on your server configurations.

Cloudflare supports several [encryption modes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/#custom-ssltls):

- Off (no encryption)
- Flexible
- Full
- Full (strict)
- Strict (SSL-Only Origin Pull)


**Use Full mode** if using a self-signed certificate.
**Use Full (strict) mode** only if your certificate is
issued by a trusted CA.
